# Diabetes Analysis and Visualization

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing a diabetes dataset sourced from Kaggle. The goal is to explore the dataset, perform data cleaning and preparation, and create meaningful visualizations to understand key patterns and relationships in the data. The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook, showcasing various data analysis techniques using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **Diabetes Dataset**, available on Kaggle. The dataset contains information on various medical attributes for patients, which can be used to predict the likelihood of developing diabetes.

- **Dataset Source:** [Kaggle Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akshaydattatraykhare/diabetes-dataset)
- **Features:**
  - `Pregnancies`: Number of pregnancies
  - `Glucose`: Plasma glucose concentration
  - `BloodPressure`: Diastolic blood pressure
  - `SkinThickness`: Triceps skinfold thickness
  - `Insulin`: 2-Hour serum insulin
  - `BMI`: Body mass index
  - `DiabetesPedigreeFunction`: Diabetes pedigree function
  - `Age`: Age of the person
  - `Outcome`: Whether the patient has diabetes (1) or not (0)

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to:
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
- Clean and preprocess the data to make it suitable for analysis.
- Create meaningful visualizations to illustrate the distribution and relationships within the data.
- Analyze key trends and insights that could be useful for further modeling.

## Technologies and Libraries Used

- **Python**: Programming language
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment for running and documenting code
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization
- **Seaborn**: Advanced data visualization
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ovochris56/diabetes-analysis.git

## Usage

## Usage

In the Jupyter Notebook `diabetes.dataset.ipynb`, I perform the following steps:

1. **Data Loading**: 
   - Load the diabetes dataset from a CSV file using Pandas and inspect the first few rows to understand its structure.

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handle any missing or null values in the dataset by either filling or removing them.
   - Address potential outliers and ensure the data types are appropriate for analysis.
   
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Generate descriptive statistics to get a summary of the dataset (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.).
   - Visualize the distribution of various features (e.g., `Glucose`, `BMI`, `Age`) using histograms and boxplots.
   - Calculate and visualize correlations between numerical features using a heatmap to identify key relationships in the data.

4. **Data Visualization**:
   - Create several plots (e.g., histograms, boxplots, pairplots, scatter plots) to visualize the distribution of key features and their relationships with the target variable (`Outcome`).
   - Explore the impact of features like `Glucose`, `BMI`, and `Age` on the likelihood of diabetes using data visualizations.
   
   You can run each section of the notebook to interactively explore the dataset and the analysis steps.

## Results and Insights

Through the analysis, I obtained several key insights:

- **Visualization 1**: 
  - The distribution of `Glucose` levels shows that many patients have elevated glucose levels, which correlates with the likelihood of having diabetes. Most patients with high glucose levels (`> 140`) tend to have diabetes (`Outcome = 1`).
  
- **Visualization 2**: 
  - A heatmap of the correlation matrix reveals that `BMI`, `Glucose`, and `Age` are strongly correlated with the target variable `Outcome`. Higher BMI and glucose levels generally increase the likelihood of diabetes.
  
- **Visualization 3**: 
  - A boxplot of `BMI` shows that people with diabetes tend to have higher BMI values compared to non-diabetic individuals. This supports the notion that obesity is a significant risk factor for diabetes.
  
- **Visualization 4**: 
  - A scatter plot of `Age` vs. `Glucose` reveals that older individuals with higher glucose levels are more likely to be diabetic. Age also appears to be an important factor influencing the presence of diabetes.

- **Key Insights**:
  - Glucose levels are a key factor in predicting diabetes. Many diabetic individuals have higher glucose levels.
  - BMI is a strong indicator of diabetes, with higher values linked to a higher probability of having the disease.
  - Age is a significant factor, with older individuals showing a higher likelihood of diabetes.

These insights provide a foundation for future modeling work, where predictive algorithms could be developed to classify individuals based on their likelihood of developing diabetes.
